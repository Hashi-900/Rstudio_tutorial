##Basic data types in R
#R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:
# Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
#Whole numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
#Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
#Text (or string) values are called characters.

## Creating Vectors.
##Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data.
##In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. 
numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <-  c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

## Naming Vector
#As a data analyst, it is important to have a clear view on the data that you are using. 
#Understanding what each element refers to is therefore essential.
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# Assign days as names of poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign days as names of roulette_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

## you can also a chieve the same result of naming a vector with more efficienct way.
# The variable days_vector
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign the names of the day to roulette_vector and poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <-   days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# You can do mathematical operations on a numeric vector
A_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
B_vector <- c(4, 5, 6)

# Take the sum of A_vector and B_vector
total_vector <- A_vector + B_vector

# Print out total_vector
total_vector

# Assign to total_daily how much you won/lost on each day
total_daily <- poker_vector + roulette_vector

total_daily
# Total winnings with poker
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)

# Total winnings with roulette
total_roulette <-  sum(roulette_vector)

# Total winnings overall
total_week <- total_poker + total_roulette

# Print out total_week
total_week

## you can make comparisons between vectors

total_poker > total_roulette

## Selecting a vector

poker_vector

poker_vector[3:4]
poker_vector[,]

poker_vector['Tuesday']

## Selection by comparisons

loss_days <- poker_vector < 0

poker_vector[loss_days]
